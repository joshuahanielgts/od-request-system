# OD Request System: RLS Policy Fix

## Problem Summary
The OD request form submission is failing due to Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues in Supabase. The current policies are too restrictive, preventing users from submitting forms.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Created New Supabase Migration
A new migration file has been created at:
```
supabase/migrations/20250925_fix_od_request_rls.sql
```

This migration implements more permissive RLS policies for the OD request system, allowing authenticated users to interact with the tables.

### 2. Modified Student Dashboard Component
Updated the StudentDashboard.tsx component to:
- Fetch and store the current authenticated user
- Use the authenticated user's ID when submitting OD requests

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Deploy the new migration to Supabase**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
   OR apply the migration manually in the Supabase dashboard SQL editor.

2. **Review the changes in StudentDashboard.tsx**
   The component now includes user authentication handling to ensure proper user ID is included in form submissions.

## Testing the Fix
After applying these changes:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the Student Dashboard
3. Submit an OD request
4. Verify that the submission completes without errors

## Long-term Recommendations
For better security in the future:
1. Create more fine-grained RLS policies once the basic functionality is working
2. Ensure proper authentication is integrated throughout the application
3. Add server-side validation for request submissions
